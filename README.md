# Trip-Record-Data-Analysis
As a skilled Data Engineer, I spearheaded a comprehensive project to extract, transform, and analyze TLC trip data records for the year 2016. Employing cutting-edge technologies on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I successfully developed a robust ETL pipeline and insightful Looker dashboard to empower stakeholders with data-driven decision-making.

The project commenced with scrapping the TLC trip data and skillfully organizing it into a star schema data model, encompassing fact and dimensional tables. The fact table housed the core trip data, while dimensional tables enriched the dataset with contextual information, optimizing data analysis efficiency.

To ensure seamless data flow and storage, I securely stored the data in GCP Cloud Storage, leveraging its scalability and reliability. Furthermore, I deployed Mage-AI onto GCP Compute Engine, a high-performance infrastructure, to drive the ETL pipeline's functionality.

Taking advantage of Mage-AI's capabilities, I skillfully extracted the TLC trip data from GCP Cloud Storage using APIs. Implementing Python-based transformation logic, I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the raw data, ensuring data quality and consistency. The transformed data was then efficiently exported to Google BigQuery, a fully-managed data warehouse, where its immense querying capabilities could be harnessed.

For in-depth data exploration, I harnessed the power of complex SQL logics, devising tailored queries to gain valuable insights. These queries involved data aggregations, filtering, and joins between fact and dimensional tables, enabling the identification of critical patterns and trends within the dataset.

To provide a visually compelling representation of the findings, I crafted a dynamic dashboard using Looker Studio. This dashboard showcased various trends in the TLC trip data, including popular pickup and drop-off locations, peak hours, ride durations, and customer demographics. The Looker dashboard empowered stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize operational processes, and identify growth opportunities.
